Healing the Community Through Mycology

The Colorado Myco League is a public charity (501c3) focused on educating the public on the many benefits that fungi can provide. We operate on the belief that giving to and guiding others in need is also a form of healing yourself.

And you can help us help everyone!

Monetary Donations

Monetary donations help us cover our basic operating expenses so we can continue to host and improve our public events, workshops, forays and do giveaways with a focus on helping those in most need.

We use Zeffy to process payments because their service is fee free for public charities. We receive 100% of your donation to use for our mission.

Under the Zeffy donation summary, we recommend changing the contribution to “other” and type in $0. If you do that, you will only pay the exact amount you wanted to donate and the full amount will be donated to The Colorado Myco League without fees.

In-Kind Donations

We also accept physical goods like mycology supplies, foraging books, coco coir, grain, mushroom grow bags, 70% isopropyl alcohol, clear Sterilite storage tubs, spores, live cultures, lab supplies, petri dishes, pressure cookers, microscopes, tincture bottles, 190 proof ethanol, mushroom supplements and even dried wild or cultivated mushrooms of all varieties. At this stage, we can use almost anything for our mission!

What About Tax Deductions?

As a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization, donations made to The Colorado Myco League are tax deductible.

As long as you receive nothing in return for your donation (IE: t-shirt, mug, supplements, etc) you may write off your full donation on your taxes.

If you get something in return for your donation, you must deduct the fair market value of the product/service you received from the donation amount before you deduct it from your taxes.

If you donate physical goods, you can write off the fair market value of those items.

We accept donations of mushrooms classified as Natural Medicine in the state of Colorado as well, but you can’t write this donation off on your taxes. This is because there is no fair market value for natural medicine on the open market because of its restricted nature. We will never sell it and always put it to good use towards our mission by re-gifting it to marginalized members of our community that most need it.

Remember the IRS limits how much you can write off on your taxes each year and in 2024 it is 60% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income.
