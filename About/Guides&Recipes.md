Original Mushroom Recipes

We believe everyone benefits from getting more mushrooms into their diet. Unfortunately, not everyone enjoys the taste of mushrooms and we totally get it. These mushroom recipes are as tasty, customizable, and straightforward as possible. If a recipe doesn’t specify a specific mushroom, you can likely use any variety of mushroom.

These downloadable recipe PDFs are formatted for printing on 4″ x 6″ cards. The black and white versions are for printing on a thermal label printer.
