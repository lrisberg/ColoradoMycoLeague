VOLUNTEER

Want to Volunteer?

We are currently looking for volunteers to:

~Lead foraging expeditions into Coloradoâ€™s wild.

~Teach mycology-related workshops (for example: growing mushrooms, cooking mushrooms, making extracts, brewing with yeasts, crafting with fungi, etc.).

If you have the knowledge and desire to help others, we can work with you to organize and sponsor personalized workshops or classes geared toward your specific mycology niche.
