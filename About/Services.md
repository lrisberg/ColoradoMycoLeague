Live Mycology Chat Platform

The heart of The Colorado Myco League has been on Discord since 2022. This is the best place to stay informed about local events, giveaways, and groundbreaking research in mycology. Join us to network with experienced mycologists, share cultivating techniques, swap recipes, learn mushroom identification & safety, and discuss anything fungi.

Monthly Mycology Meetup Events

Everyone is welcome to join us for learning and/or sharing their unique perspective on mycology. We encourage you to share mushroom themed gifts and network with novice and expert mycologists alike. Find all our sponsored events on the Events page.

Wild Mushroom Foraging & Identification

We organize educational forays into nature to find and identify mushrooms in their natural habitat. Mushroom foraging books specific to Colorado are excellent companions on these trips. We may not know every mushroom out there by heart, but we certainly know the steps needed to get them identified correctly. If we can’t figure it out together, we will help you get them in front of someone who can. Stay tuned for these events in our Discord server and Events page.
