Wild Mushroom Foraging & Identification

Starting in 2024, we have begun to plan and organize educational forays into nature to find and identify mushrooms in their natural habitat. Mushroom foraging books specific to Colorado are recommended companions on these trips. We don’t claim to know every mushroom out there by heart but we certainly know the steps needed to get them identified correctly. If we can’t figure it out together, we will help you get them in front of someone who can. These events will mostly be organized in our Discord server and will also be listed on our events page.
