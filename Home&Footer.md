What We’re About

Though this group is based out of Colorado, we encourage anyone from anywhere to join in on the learning and fun. We believe mushrooms are medicine and can offer effective and safe support for physical and mental health. We emphasize community, personal wellness, and the health benefits that mushrooms of all types can provide. Our goal is to destigmatize mushrooms by providing fun and educational mushroom content, hosting mycology classes and giveaways, organizing meet-ups and foraging outings, and much more.
