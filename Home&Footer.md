What We’re About

Though this group is based out of Colorado, we would like to encourage anyone from anywhere to participate and join in on the learning and fun. We believe that nearly all mushrooms are medicine and can be used as an effective and comparatively safe approach to support physical and mental health. We emphasize community, personal wellness, and the health benefits that mushrooms of all types can provide. Ultimately our goal is to destigmatize mushrooms by providing plenty of fun and educational mushroom content, do occasional giveaways, plan mycology themed events like mycology classes, meet-ups, foraging outings and much more.
