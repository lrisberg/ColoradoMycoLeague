SOCIAL MEDIA

The Colorado Myco League engages with the community in three chief places: Discord, Facebook and Instagram. Discord is where most of the activity takes place.

In our Discord, we focus on planning and announcing events, hosting giveaways, sharing groundbreaking research in mycology, assisting with mushroom identification and safety, sharing cultivating techniques, encouraging networking, swapping recipes, and educating the public in everything fungi.

Why Discord?

We’ve heard it all over the years: “Discord is for gamers…”, “Discord is confusing…”, “Discord is annoying!”, and my favorite: “Discord sucks!”

Hear me out… Discord is what YOU make it.

Discord provides us access to a free, fully customizable live chat platform we can use for any purpose without built in AI or algorithmic control over the content you see.

And we agree: most Discord servers are confusing. They often have too many channels on too many overly specific or overly vague topics. And it is way too easy to overdo it on the freely available helper-bots. When a new user takes a single look at the average Discord server, analysis paralysis kicks in and they head for the exit. If the bots and channel lists don’t deter them, the barrage of notifications will convince them to mute the server altogether, defeating the purpose.

When The Colorado Myco League began using Discord in December on 2022, we aimed to address all of those problems by:

1) Keeping the channel list short and descriptive.

2) Making the experience as safe and easy to use as possible for the largest number of people.

3) Hosting giveaways. Everyone loves a ping for a good giveaway.

To make our chat platform more family friendly, we divide our channels into three levels:

All Ages: Appropriate for ages 13+.

Age Restricted: Channels regarding the discussion of psychoactive substances for Adults 18+. We use Discord’s built-in age verification to implement this.

Age Verified: Only for ages 21+. To gain access to this channel, a Colorado Myco League representative must manually verify your age. This channel deals with the gifting of natural medicine for personal use.

If the Discord notifications are getting out of hand, we encourage you to mute any specific channels that don’t interest you. That way, you’ll never miss the best posts and giveaways.

Facebook and Instagram

We don’t like big brother looking over our shoulder as much as the next guy, but as an organization we decided we need to go where we can do the most good for the most people. Our organization expanded our reach to Facebook and Instagram in 2024.

Unfortunately, because of the ever present algorithms and AI, we have to limit what we post on these platforms. AI still doesn’t know the difference between an oyster and a cube. We still plan on posting announcements and worthwhile content on Facebook and Instagram whenever it makes sense to do so. Please send us your questions and comments and engage with us through any platform we are on. We are always happy to help.
