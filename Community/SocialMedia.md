SOCIAL MEDIA

The Colorado Myco League currently engages with the community in three main places, Discord, Facebook and Instagram. With Discord being the place where most of the activity takes place.

Why Discord?

We’ve heard it all over the years… “Discord is for gamers…”, “Discord is confusing…”, “Discord is annoying!” and my favorite… “Discord sucks!”

Hear me out… Discord is what YOU make it.

Discord provides us access to a free fully customizable live chat platform that we can use for any purpose and without built in AI or algorithmic control over the content you get to see.

And we agree… most Discord servers are confusing. This is because they tend to have WAY too many channels on way too many overly specific or overly vague topics. And it is way too easy to overdo it on the freely available helper-bots. When a new user takes a single look the average Discord server, analysis paralysis kicks in and they head for the exit. If the bots and channel lists don’t deter them, the barrage of notifications will convince them to mute the server altogether. Defeating the purpose.

When The Colorado Myco League was started on Discord in December on 2022, we aimed to address all of those problems by doing the following:

1) Keep the channel list as short and descriptive as possible.

2) Make the experience as safe and easy to use as possible for the largest number of people.

3) Do giveaways… everyone loves a ping for a good giveaway.

In our Discord we also focus on openly planning and announcing events, run giveaways, share groundbreaking research in mycology, assist with mushroom identification and safety, share cultivating techniques, encourage networking, swap recipes and educate the public in everything fungi. To make our chat platform more family friendly we divide our channels into three levels…

All Ages: Generally appropriate for ages 13+.

Age Restricted: Channels regarding the open discussion of intoxicating substances for Adults 18+. We use Discords built in age verification to implement this.

Age Verified: Only for those that have manually been verified to be 21+ by a representative of The Colorado Myco League. They will gain access to a hidden additional channel dealing with the gifting of natural medicine for personal use.

Join Our Discord

If the Discord notifications are getting out of hand, do yourself a favor and don’t mute the entire discord server… we instead encourage you to mute specific channels that don’t interest you. That way you’ll never miss the best posts and givaways. Heck, mute every channel except the giveaway channels for all we care! If you find our Discord server BORING then you aren’t participating or paying attention.

Facebook and Instagram

We don’t like big brother looking over our shoulder as much as the next guy. But as an organization we decided that we need to go where we can do the most good for the most people. So in 2024 our organization expanded our reach to Facebook and Instagram.

Unfortunately because of the ever present algorithms and AI… we have to limit what we can post on these platforms because AI still doesn’t know the diffrence between an oyster and a cube. We still plan on posting announcements and worthwhile content on Facebook and Instagram whenever it makes sense to do so. Please send us your questions or comments and engage with us through any platform we are on. We are always happy to help.
